# eloquentDocker
I implemented an earlier version of eloquent,but used Docker Images to get it up and running.
Configuration inolves downlading of Docker
To run use: docker-compose up -d in the same Directory as the docker-compose.yml
The vendor folder is created nby eloquent. Delete it and install composer which should handles the dependencies.
